To install: 

    npm i react-router-dom

Based on links(url) the component changes which feels like a new page is loaded.
 { jaise he link(url) change kiya, nya component aaya screen pe, jiske karan aisa laga ki nya page aaya.}

 This package provides us with few react component which provies functionality on the UI. 

        ==> Router  Route   Switch   Link



 Note : We want that with different addresses of url , different component should be displayed in the screen
 
       That is the only reason the Switch was inplemented for various cases.

        ===> We have imported BrowserRouter as Router 
        

<Route> ===> It has an attribut named path which has the URL path.

              So ye kehta hai ki agar mera path ye hai to mere andar wala component 
              dikhaya jaya.

              That's is the only reason we have implemente various routes for our different URL.

<Link> ==> It is same as anchor tag(<a>).

<a> ko <Link> tag mai convert karne se page reload nhi hua.

In <Link>, the href is <a> is replaced by to.



=========================================================================================================================

<Route> in itself is like an individual if statement. Agar mera path match hua, to mai component display kar dunga.

To agar bahut sare <Route> hote, to multiple if true ho sakte hain ek sath.(/) (/customers) (/rentals) (/login) path

ke agar char Route hain
       ( Kyunki path ki partial matching hoti hai. 

              To agar url mai hai http://localhost:3000/customers

              To (/) wala path bhi  true
              aur (/customers) wala path bhi true.
              
              To Ye dono display honge.
       )

So isiliye "Switch"  use kiya taki agar ek bhi true ho, to baki ke route ko check na kare.

Note: This is the reason path(/) is at the bottom. 
       ( Kyunki agar upr hua to pehle he true ho jaega aur wahi display hota rahega )
